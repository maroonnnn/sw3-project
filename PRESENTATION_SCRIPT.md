## Slide 1: Title Slide (1 minute)

### What's on Screen:
- Restaurant Ordering System title
- Team members
- Date

### Speaking Points:

> "Our project is a comprehensive Restaurant Ordering System that digitalizes the entire food ordering workflow—from the customer browsing the menu, to the kitchen preparing the order, all the way to delivery tracking."

> "This system addresses real-world problems that restaurants face daily, and we'll be building it using Agile methodology over the next few months."

## Slide 2: Project Idea - Overview (3 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- The Problem (5 bullet points)
- Our Solution

### Speaking Points - The Problem:

> "Let me start by explaining the problem we're solving."

> **Point to first bullet** "Traditional restaurants rely heavily on manual order taking. A waiter writes orders on paper, which leads to handwriting errors, miscommunication with the kitchen, and ultimately, wrong orders being served."

> **Point to second bullet** "Customers often wait a long time just to place their orders, especially during peak hours. This frustration leads to poor customer experience."

> **Point to third bullet** "Kitchen staff receive these paper orders, which get messy, wet, or lost in a busy kitchen environment. There's no clear system for prioritizing orders."

> **Point to fourth bullet** "When it comes to delivery, customers have no idea where their food is. They keep calling the restaurant asking 'Where's my order?'"

> **Point to fifth bullet** "Managing peak hours becomes chaotic without proper systems in place."

### Speaking Points - The Solution:

> "Our solution is a comprehensive digital platform that connects all stakeholders in the restaurant ecosystem."

> "Instead of paper and phone calls, everything happens through our system—customers order online, kitchen sees orders on a digital screen, delivery drivers track their routes, and managers get real-time analytics."

> "This isn't just a website; it's a complete management system."

## Slide 3: Key Features (3 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- 4 feature cards (Online Menu, Order Placement, Kitchen Management, Delivery Tracking)

### Speaking Points:

> "Our system has four core features, each designed for a specific user group."

#### Feature 1 - Online Menu:
> **Point to first card** "First, we have the Online Menu. Customers can browse an interactive digital menu with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, prices, and most importantly—real-time availability. If the kitchen runs out of something, it automatically shows as unavailable."

#### Feature 2 - Order Placement:
> **Point to second card** "Second is Order Placement. Customers can easily add items to their cart, customize them—like 'no onions' or 'extra cheese'—and include special instructions. The interface is intuitive and works on any device."

#### Feature 3 - Kitchen Management:
> **Point to third card** "Third, Kitchen Management. This is where the magic happens. Kitchen staff see all incoming orders on a digital display, no more paper! They can update the status—from received, to preparing, to ready—and the customer sees these updates in real-time."

#### Feature 4 - Delivery Tracking:
> **Point to fourth card** "Finally, Delivery Tracking. This is what customers love most. They can track their order status, see where the delivery driver is on a map, and get estimated arrival times. No more anxiety about 'where's my food?'"

> "These four features work together seamlessly to create an end-to-end solution."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 4]**

## Slide 4: Target Users (2 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- 4 user role boxes (Customers, Kitchen Staff, Delivery Drivers, Restaurant Managers)

### Speaking Points:

> "Our system serves four distinct user groups, each with different needs."

> **Point to Customers box** "Customers—they want to easily browse, order, pay, and track their food. They want convenience."

> **Point to Kitchen Staff box** "Kitchen Staff—they need to see all orders clearly, manage preparation workflow, and update statuses quickly during busy hours."

> **Point to Delivery Drivers box** "Delivery Drivers—they need clear delivery assignments, navigation help, and an easy way to update delivery status."

> **Point to Restaurant Managers box** "Restaurant Managers—they need the big picture. They manage the menu, monitor operations, view sales analytics, and make data-driven decisions."

> "Each role has a customized interface designed specifically for their workflow."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 5]**

## Slide 5: Methodology - Agile/Scrum (3 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- Scrum definition
- 5 process steps (Product Backlog, Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Retrospective)

### Speaking Points:

> "Now let's talk about how we're building this system. We're using Agile methodology, specifically the Scrum framework."

> "Scrum is an iterative approach where we work in short cycles called sprints, each lasting two weeks."

### Explain the Process:

> **Point to Product Backlog** "First, we have a Product Backlog—a prioritized list of all features we want to build. We continuously refine this based on feedback and changing requirements."

> **Point to Sprint Planning** "At the start of each sprint, we hold Sprint Planning. The team looks at the backlog and decides what we can realistically complete in the next two weeks. We set a clear sprint goal."

> **Point to Daily Standup** "Every day, we have a 15-minute Daily Standup meeting. Each team member quickly answers: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Any blockers? This keeps everyone aligned."

> **Point to Sprint Review** "At the end of the sprint, we hold a Sprint Review where we demo the completed features to stakeholders—in our case, the professor or a restaurant owner. This is where we get feedback."

> **Point to Retrospective** "Finally, we do a Retrospective where the team reflects: What went well? What didn't? How can we improve? Then we start the cycle again."

> "This cycle repeats every two weeks, and we continuously deliver working software."

## Slide 6: Why We Use Scrum (4 minutes) ⭐ IMPORTANT SLIDE

### What's on Screen:
- 7 benefits with icons

### Speaking Points:

> "This is a crucial question: Why Scrum? Why not traditional Waterfall methodology? Let me give you seven compelling reasons."

#### Reason 1 - Flexibility:
> **Point to first item** "Number one: Flexibility. In Waterfall, you decide all requirements upfront and can't change them. But in a restaurant system, requirements change constantly. Maybe the owner wants to add a 'split payment' feature, or integrate with a new payment provider. With Scrum, we can adapt the backlog and add new features in the next sprint without disrupting everything."

#### Reason 2 - Fast Delivery:
> **Point to second item** "Number two: Fast Delivery. Instead of waiting six months to see anything, stakeholders get working features every two weeks. After Sprint 1, customers can already browse the menu and register. After Sprint 2, they can place orders. This builds confidence and allows early testing."

#### Reason 3 - Clear Priorities:
> **Point to third item** "Number three: Clear Priorities. Not all features are equally important. Order placement is critical—we build that first. Advanced analytics? Nice to have—we build that later. Scrum forces us to prioritize based on business value."

#### Reason 4 - Transparency:
> **Point to fourth item** "Number four: Transparency. Everyone knows exactly what's being worked on. If I'm on vacation, my teammates know my tasks. If a professor asks about progress, we can show our Jira board immediately. No surprises."

#### Reason 5 - Early Bug Detection:
> **Point to fifth item** "Number five: Early Bug Detection. We test continuously, not just at the end. If we discover a critical bug in Sprint 2, we fix it immediately, not six months later when the entire system is built."

#### Reason 6 - Team Collaboration:
> **Point to sixth item** "Number six: Team Collaboration. Daily standups ensure we're not working in silos. If I'm stuck on a problem, I mention it in standup, and a teammate who solved something similar can help me."

#### Reason 7 - Continuous Improvement:
> **Point to seventh item** "Number seven: Continuous Improvement. Retrospectives are powerful. If we find that our sprint planning meetings are too long, we adjust the format. If code reviews are creating bottlenecks, we add more reviewers. We get better with each sprint."

> "These seven reasons make Scrum the perfect choice for a complex, multi-user system like ours."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 7]**

## Slide 7: User Stories - Customer Features (3 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- 4 user stories for customers

### Speaking Points:

> "Now let's look at how we capture requirements. In Agile, we use User Stories written from the user's perspective."

> "Each story follows the format: 'As a [user], I want to [action], so that [benefit].' This keeps us focused on user value, not just technical implementation."

### Pick ONE story to explain in detail:

> "Let me walk you through one example in detail."

> **Point to third story (Track Order)** "This story says: 'As a customer, I want to track my order status in real-time, so that I know when my food will arrive.'"

> "Notice three things: First, WHO—a customer. Second, WHAT—track order status in real-time. Third, WHY—to know when food arrives. This context is crucial."

> "Below, we have acceptance criteria—specific conditions that must be met for this story to be considered 'Done.'"

> "We also have story points—in this case, 13 points—which represents the complexity. We estimate this using a technique called Planning Poker where the team votes on complexity."

> "And priority—this is High because customers really value knowing where their food is."

### Quick mention of other stories:

> "The other stories follow the same structure. Browse menu, add to cart, customize orders, make payments—each captures a specific customer need."

> "We have similar stories for kitchen staff, delivery drivers, and managers."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 8]**

## Slide 8: User Stories - Kitchen & Delivery (2 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- 4 user stories (2 for kitchen, 1 for delivery, 1 for manager)

### Speaking Points:

> "Here are user stories for our other user groups."

> **Point to first story** "Kitchen staff need to see all pending orders on a digital display—this replaces paper tickets."

> **Point to second story** "They also need to update order status as they cook, which automatically notifies the customer."

> **Point to third story** "Delivery drivers need to see their assigned deliveries with customer addresses and order details."

> **Point to fourth story** "And restaurant managers need to manage the menu—add new items, update prices, or remove discontinued dishes."

> "In total, we have over 20 user stories organized into 4 epics. Each epic represents a major feature area."

> "All of these are tracked in our Jira backlog, which I'll show you next."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 9]**

---

## Slide 9: Sprint Planning Example (2 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- 4 sprint boxes with tasks listed

### Speaking Points:

> "Here's how we've organized our work into sprints."

> **Point to Sprint 1** "Sprint 1, our foundation sprint. We set up the project structure, implement user authentication, and create a basic menu display. By the end of week 2, users can register and view the menu."

> **Point to Sprint 2** "Sprint 2 focuses on core ordering features. Shopping cart, order placement, and the kitchen dashboard. By week 4, customers can place complete orders."

> **Point to Sprint 3** "Sprint 3 is about order management. We add status updates, real-time notifications using WebSockets, and delivery driver assignment. Now the full workflow is connected."

> **Point to Sprint 4** "Finally, Sprint 4 is for polish and administrative features. Manager dashboards, analytics, payment integration, and thorough testing."

> "This gives us a working system in 8 weeks, with the option to add more sprints for advanced features like loyalty programs or AI-powered recommendations."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 10]**

## Slide 10: Jira Workflow & Screenshots (4 minutes) ⭐ IMPORTANT SLIDE

### What's on Screen:
- Placeholders for 3 Jira screenshots

### Speaking Points:

> "Now let me show you how we're actually managing this project using Jira."

### Screenshot 1 - Product Backlog:
> **Point to first image** "This is our Product Backlog in Jira. You can see all our user stories organized and prioritized. Each story has an epic label—notice the color coding: blue for Customer Experience, green for Kitchen Operations, orange for Delivery, purple for Management."

> "Stories at the top are high priority—these are the features we'll build first. Notice the story point estimates on the right side."

#### If you have real screenshot:
> "You can see we currently have [X] stories in our backlog, totaling about [Y] story points."

#### If placeholder:
> "We're in the process of setting up our Jira workspace, and this section will show our complete backlog with all 20+ stories."

### Screenshot 2 - Sprint Board:
> **Point to second image** "This is our Sprint Board—the heart of our daily work. It has four columns: To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done."

> "During our daily standup, we look at this board. Tasks move from left to right as we work on them. This gives instant visibility into what everyone is doing."

> "Notice that we try to limit the 'In Progress' column—we focus on finishing tasks before starting new ones."

#### If you have real screenshot:
> "Currently, we have [X] stories in progress and [Y] completed in this sprint."

### Screenshot 3 - Burndown Chart:
> **Point to third image** "This is our Sprint Burndown Chart. The gray line shows ideal progress—if we complete work evenly over the sprint. The blue line shows actual progress."

> "This chart helps us spot problems early. If the actual line is way above the ideal line mid-sprint, we know we're behind and need to adjust."

> "It's a powerful tool for the team to self-organize and meet our sprint commitments."

> "These tools—Backlog, Board, and Burndown—are what make Scrum work in practice."

**[ADVANCE TO SLIDE 11]**

## Slide 11: Technology Stack (2 minutes)

### What's on Screen:
- 6 technology boxes
- Why these technologies section

### Speaking Points:

> "Let me quickly mention our technology choices."

> **Point to tech boxes** "We're using modern, industry-standard technologies. React for the frontend to create a smooth, responsive user interface. Node.js on the backend because it handles concurrent connections well—important when many orders come in at once."

> "PostgreSQL for our database gives us reliable data storage with relationships between users, orders, and menu items."

> "Socket.io enables real-time features—when a kitchen updates an order status, the customer sees it instantly without refreshing."

> "And of course, Git for version control and Jira for project management, which we've been discussing."

> **Point to 'Why these technologies' section** "The key reason for these choices is that they support our real-time requirements and scale well as the restaurant grows."

## 💬 Q&A Preparation (5-10 minutes)

### Expected Questions & Answers:

#### Q1: "How did you decide on story point estimates?"

**Answer:**
> "We use Planning Poker as a team. Everyone sees the user story, we discuss the complexity, and each person votes using Fibonacci numbers (1, 3, 5, 8, 13). If votes differ significantly, we discuss why and revote until we reach consensus. Story points represent complexity and effort, not time."

---

#### Q2: "What if a sprint goal isn't met?"

**Answer:**
> "That's normal in Agile. If we don't complete all stories, we don't force it. Unfinished stories go back to the backlog. In the retrospective, we analyze why—maybe we overestimated our capacity or faced unexpected technical challenges. We adjust our velocity for the next sprint based on actual data."

---

#### Q3: "Why Agile instead of Waterfall for this project?"

**Answer:**
> "Three main reasons: First, restaurant requirements change—they might want new features based on customer feedback. Waterfall doesn't handle changes well. Second, stakeholders want to see progress quickly, not wait until everything is done. Third, we're a student team still learning—Agile's iterative nature lets us learn and improve as we go."

---

#### Q4: "How do you handle conflicts in the team?"

**Answer:**
> "Daily standups help prevent conflicts by keeping everyone aligned. If disagreements arise, we discuss them openly in retrospectives. For technical decisions, we might vote or defer to the team member with most expertise in that area. The key is transparent communication."

---

#### Q5: "What's the difference between a task and a user story?"

**Answer:**
> "A user story is a feature from the user's perspective with business value—like 'As a customer, I want to track my order.' A task is a technical step to complete that story—like 'Create API endpoint for order status' or 'Design tracking UI component.' User stories are in the backlog; tasks are created during sprint planning."

---

#### Q6: "How long does each sprint ceremony take?"

**Answer:**
> "For a 2-week sprint: Sprint Planning is 2-4 hours, Daily Standup is exactly 15 minutes every day, Sprint Review is 1-2 hours, and Retrospective is about 1 hour. So roughly 5-8 hours of ceremonies per 80-hour sprint—that's about 10% of our time."

---

#### Q7: "What if a critical bug is found mid-sprint?"

**Answer:**
> "We assess the severity. If it's truly critical—like payment not working—we add it to the current sprint immediately and may remove a less critical story to make room. If it's not urgent, it goes to the backlog and gets prioritized for the next sprint."

---

#### Q8: "How do you ensure code quality?"

**Answer:**
> "Multiple ways: First, our Definition of Done includes code review—another developer must review before merging. Second, we write unit tests for critical functionality. Third, we do integration testing at the end of each sprint. Fourth, retrospectives help us identify quality issues and improve our process."

---

#### Q9: "What makes a good user story?"

**Answer:**
> "We use the INVEST criteria: Independent (can be developed alone), Negotiable (details flexible), Valuable (provides user value), Estimable (can be estimated), Small (fits in a sprint), Testable (clear acceptance criteria). A good story is written from user perspective, is specific, and focuses on the 'what' and 'why,' not the 'how.'"

---

#### Q10: "Why use Jira instead of simpler tools?"

**Answer:**
> "Jira is industry standard, especially for Scrum teams. It has built-in features we need—backlog management, sprint boards, burndown charts, velocity tracking. Learning Jira now prepares us for real software companies. That said, tools are just tools—the methodology matters more than the specific software."
