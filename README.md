## 📞 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Why Restaurant Ordering System?
**A:** It's a real-world problem with multiple user types, complex workflows, and demonstrates various software engineering concepts like real-time updates, state management, and role-based access.

### Q: Why Scrum over Waterfall?
**A:** Restaurant requirements change frequently (menu items, prices, features). Scrum allows us to adapt quickly and deliver working features every 2 weeks instead of waiting months.

### Q: How do you estimate story points?
**A:** We use Planning Poker technique. Team discusses the story, considers complexity, and votes. Story points represent effort, not time. We use Fibonacci sequence: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13.

### Q: What happens if you don't finish the sprint?
**A:** Unfinished stories move back to backlog. In retrospective, we discuss why and adjust our velocity estimate for next sprint.

### Q: How do you handle urgent bugs?
**A:** Critical bugs are added to current sprint immediately. Medium/low priority bugs go to backlog and are prioritized like features.
